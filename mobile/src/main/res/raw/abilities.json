Attacks with a recharge turn, such as hyper beam, do not have to recharge; attacks with a preparation turn, such as fly, do not end up being used.  Moves that are forced over multiple turns and keep going through failure, such as outrage, uproar, or any move forced by encore, keep going as usual.\n\nIf this Pok\u00e9mon is confused, its confusion is not checked when loafing around; the Pok\u00e9mon cannot hurt itself, and its confusion does not end or come closer to ending.\n\nIf this Pok\u00e9mon attempts to move but fails, e.g. because of paralysis or gravity, it still counts as having moved and will loaf around the next turn.  If it does not attempt to move, e.g. because it is asleep or frozen, whatever it would have done will be postponed until its next attempt; that is, it will either loaf around or move as usual, depending on what it last did.\n\nThis ability cannot be changed with worry seed, but it can be disabled with gastro acid, changed with role play, or traded away with skill swap."

This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example color change or forecast; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from drizzle.  This ability cannot ignore multitype at all.\n\nAn ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  For example, this Pok\u00e9mon's moves can paralyze a Pok\u00e9mon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pok\u00e9mon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.\n\nWhen this Pok\u00e9mon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.\n\nThis ability functions identically to mold breaker and turboblaze."
